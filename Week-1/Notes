SQL for Data Science |  UC Davis | Coursera | Week-1

SQL stands for "Structured Query Language" is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation.

Inshort: SQL used to query, insert, update and modify data.

Who uses SQL?
Backend Developer, Data Architect, QA Engineer, ETL Developer, Database Admin (DBA), Data Analyst, System Admin, System Engineer, Data Scientist

How do DBA use SQL?
Manages/governs entire database; Gives permissions to users; Determines access to data; Manages and creates tables; Uses SQL to query and retrieve data.

How do data scientists use SQL?
End user of a database, Use SQL to query and retrieve data

List of Relational Database Management Systems
SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, Sybase ASE, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Apache Open Office Base, SQLite(This Course)

Types of Databases Models: Relational and Transactional(which is also called as Opertaional Model)

Relational Model: Allows for easy querying and data manipulation in an easy, logical and intuitive way.
Transactional Model: Operational database - insurance claims within a healthcare database

Note: SQL, usually tends to communicate with relational database management system.

Data Model Building Blocks  
Entity: Person, place thing or event, Distinguishable, unique and distinct
Attribute: Characteristic of an entity
Relationship: One-to-Many, Many-to-many, One-to-One

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram Examples
One-to-many: customer to invoices.
Many-to-many: student to classes.
One-to-one: manager to store.

Retrieving data from SELECT statement, For example:
SELECT prod_name;
FROM Products

For multiple columns, be sure to use a comma, For example:
SELECT prod_name,
prod_id,
prod_price,
FROM Products

Request all columns by using a asterisk(*) wildcard character, For example:
SELECT *
FROM Products

Limit the results, if the database is too large, For example:
SELECT *
FROM Products
LIMIT 5;

Limiting results using different syntaxes,  
For example: SQLlite
SELECT *
FROM Products
LIMIT 5;

For example: ORACLE
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE ROWNUM <=5;

For example: DB2
SELECT *
FROM Products
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;

NULL and Primary Keys
Every column is either NULL or NOT NULL.
Primary keys cannot be null, they must have a value.

Create Table from CREATE statement, For example:
CREATE TABLE Shoes
(
Id char(10) PRIMARY KEY
Brand char(10)  NOT NULL,
Type char(250) NOT NULL,
Color char(250) NOT NULL,
Price decimal(8, 2) NOT NULL,
Desc Varchar(750) NULL
);

Inserting data into the Table, For example:
INSERT INTO  Shoes
VALUES('14535974',
'Gucci',
'Slippers',
'Pink',
'695.00',
NULL
);

Create Temporary table, For example:
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Sandals AS
(
SELECT *
FROM Shoes
WHERE shoe_type ='sandals'
)

Adding Comments
Single Line, For example:
SELECT shoe_id
--, brand_id
,shoe_name
FROM shoes

Section, For example:
SELECT shoe_id
/*, brand_id
,shoe_name
*/
FROM shoes

SUMMARY
-CREATE TABLE (SQLlite Supports, REAL, INTEGER, TEXT, NOT NULL and Primary Keys must be unique)
-SELECT (,commas are important) can be used as "Filtering or Retrieving"
-FROM and WHERE
-LIMIT X;
-INSERT INTO
-CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (Efficient and Faster, but Terminates After Sometime)
-COMMENT In SQL "--"  (Single Line) and /* ... */ (Section)
